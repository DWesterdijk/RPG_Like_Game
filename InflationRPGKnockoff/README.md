# Inventory System
I wanted to make an RPG game, and every rpg game needs an Inventory, and that is exactly what I did here.

## Features
-GUI-drawn Inventory
-Drag and Drop
-On-Hover Tooltip

## Software Analysis
I was looking around at all the possible engines/platforms/languages to make this Inventory system on.
At first I wanted to try it in c++ to learn more about c++, but since Unreal is not my favoured engine (anymore)
I decided to blow that off. c++ still seems like a good option, in another engine or just with plain code.
But to make it easier for myself I went to take a look in Javascript, but since I am not well educated in that yet I decided not to do that.
So my final option was in c#, and ofcourse to use Unity engine.
It is still my favourite free engine to use, it works fine, and has a lot of options and libraries to use.

## What I wanted to learn
- I wanted to make an easy accesible Inventory system.
- I wanted it to be possible to drag and drop around items.

## Planning

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|Week 1 | Setting up the project | Research what was the best to use & Write down what I need to make & Start writing code (if there's time left) | Writing the Code of the inventory system & testing it | Writing the Code of the inventory system & testing it | Writing the Code of the inventory system & testing it |
|Week 2 | Writing the Code of the inventory system & testing it | Once it works, Polish the code and make it more user friendly | Deliver it | Done | Done |
